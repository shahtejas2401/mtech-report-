My foremost gratitude and respects to my guide Dr. Rupesh Nasre for his guidance, motivation and moral support in my execution of this project work. His passionate talks about the subject and the many hour-long discussions renewed the zeal in me to keep trying despite the unsatisfying results. His patience with students has been incredible.

I thank Somesh Singh and other PACE lab students for lending their immense help in my work. 

I thank all my classmates and seniors in IITM for their presence that made life happy and incredible here. Their inputs have been significant in every step of these two years.

I thank my parents for being highly accommodating of my erratic schedules and for their love and support. I thank God for making all of this happen.
