The betweenness centrality index is essential in the analysis of social networks, but costly to compute. Currently, the fastest known algorithm requires $O(n*m)$ time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ is the number of actors in the network and $m$ is total number of connections amongst them which are unweighted. The existing  Brandes' algorithm does all pairs shortest path and calculates centrality. New algorithms for betweenness of a graph are introduced which tried to improvise the execution time using the same time complexity but failed to do so with respect to existing best available algorithm. However, time complexity has been improved for Trees whereas some execution time improvisation has been achieved for DAGs also.
